// plans
// I think having a science tab set up like a story section

// this section will have a button that will unlock new things as its pressed

// --- dig in the mud ---- rummage through something???? ---- 
    // the 1st science option i will have as a button that gives you the option to dig
    // this will give you maybe mud as a currency, or maybe every x diggs you get something?
    // regardless of that after a little while we can dig up a scientist? maybe?
    // this can be a seporate mini game that allows for more scientists
    // we can afford for this section to be played super slowely as it goes along side the actual game
    
    //---- excavation ----
        // just like the main game
        // get some sort of digging tool
        // use a specialist to automate the tool
        // get mud from the tool
        // spend mud getting scientists?
            // maybe filter the mud for sciency things? fossils? researchable stuff?????
    
    // rather than unlock a currency from digging we unlock a percentage of a scientist?????

    // --- Spend milk getting the stuff for digging
    // --- the stuff excavates scientists


    // i have already made a bulldozer so its probably a shout to make more exavation equiptment that allows for faster digging/automated digging

// ---- Scientist ----
    // with the newley uncovered scientist we can start earning science
    // scientists earn science automatically
    // scientists unlock upgrades with science
    // maybe find the new cows?

    // ----- CURRENCY: science [or some kind of science cow pun]
    //          science unlocks stuff for the rest of the game, both digging stuff and milking stuff.
